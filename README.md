## If you want to run it on your local computer, follow these steps:

## Prerequisites:

- Node.js: Install Node.js, which is required for running React projects. You can download from the official Node.js website.

- npm (Node Package Manager): npm is included with Node.js. It allows you to download and install packages and dependencies needed for your React project.

- Git: Git is a version control system used for tracking changes in source code. You’ll need Git installed to run the React project from GitHub. Get the latest version of Git from their official website.

- Now Clone the Repository and then
  Open your terminal or command prompt.
  Navigate to the directory where you want to store the React project.
  Run the following command to clone the GitHub repository:
  git clone https://github.com/programming-hero-web-course1/l2-b2-assignment-5-frontend-AbulFozolJumman.git


- Install Dependencies:
  Inside the project directory, run the following command to install the project dependencies listed in the package.json file:
  npm install

- If any issues arise during installation, you can try automatically fixing them with:
  npm audit fix

- Start the Development Server:
  Finally, start the local development server by running:
  npm run dev

- This command will launch the React project in your default web browser. You can access it by navigating to http://localhost:5173/

You’re all set! Now you can edit and explore the React project locally.
